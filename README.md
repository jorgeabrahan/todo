Website to manage your things to-do. It was developed using vanilla JS and LocalStorage API to store all the information added by the user. 
Contains all the CRUD basic operations to create, read, update or delete data from the LocalStorage. Also includes a filter for the tasks (all, complete, incomplete). I programmed a search input to look up for a specific task and identify those with the same title or description than the one the user is looking for.
Every task can be marked as complete or incomplete and also be deleted or edited.
